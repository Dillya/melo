This file intends to describe how to retrieve and compile Melo from a clean
setup.

Build from source tarball
=========================

Melo uses the autotools build system for configuring, compiling and installing
binaries and associated files. So, basically, Melo can be compiled with the
commands commonly used with autotools.

After downloading and extracted the latest tarball release from Melo with the
following commands:

    tar xzf melo-latest.tar.gz
    cd melo-latest

To configure, compile and install Melo, please use the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Melo will be installed on your root file system, under the /usr/local/bin path.

Build from git source
=====================

In order to build from git sources, you need to generate build system files
with the autogen.sh script provided in the repository.
This script needs some additional tools like autoconf and automake.

To initialize a basic build system, please use the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/dillya/melo.git
    cd melo
    ./autogen.sh

When initialization is done, building is exactly the same as with the source
tarball. So, for more details, please read Build from source tarball section.
